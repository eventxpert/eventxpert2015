        <h:outputText value="Everyone wants to make their celebrations, events, ceremonies and functions truly
            memorable. But before every such event and behind every such celebration, a lot of
            planning, co-ordination and execution are involved. This very thought in todayâs world is
            becoming extremely dissuading for many to even think of such events. What if someone
            did all the groundwork behind the scenes and executed everything just the way it was
            planned that too at just click of a button!.
            This precisely is our space. As our very name suggests, at âEventXpertâ, we are a group
            of professionals with a focus on making the celebrations and events memorable for our
            customers. We provide Event Management Solutions. We are stepping into the Event
            Management market space with a difference. Our unique proposition is that we are
            customer-centered and want to help them plan their events and execute them in an
            absolutely hassle free and cost effective way."/>
